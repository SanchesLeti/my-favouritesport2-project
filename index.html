          <p>
          It is a great workout: Swimming is a low-impact exercise that provides
          a full-body workout. It strengthens the muscles, improves
          cardiovascular health, and increases the body's flexibility and range
          of motion. It is a stress-reliever: Swimming can help reduce stress
          and anxiety. Being in the water promotes relaxation, and the rhythmic
          motion of swimming can have a calming effect on the mind. It is a
          social activity: Swimming is a great way to meet new people and make
          friends. It can be enjoyed in groups, such as swimming clubs or teams,
          or individually.
